Cleaning Bank Marketing Campaign Data

Personal loans are a lucrative revenue stream for banks. The typical interest rate of a two-year loan in the United Kingdom is 
around 10%
. This might not sound like a lot, but in September 2022 alone UK consumers borrowed 
around £1.5 billion
, which would mean approximately £300 million in interest generated by banks over two years!
